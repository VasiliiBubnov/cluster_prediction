# cluster_prediction
Here we have a prototype for predicting Forex quotes movement. The quotes are classified into different categories via a clustering method, depending on the Open, High, Low, Close .
Subsequently, they are converted into text format. Then, the time series of these clusters is processed akin to text by a neural network, and the prediction of the quotes is formed as a straightforward 
text generation process. This strategy is akin to 'translating' the language of Open, High, Low, Close  into a language that our AI model can comprehend and use to anticipate future market movements.
